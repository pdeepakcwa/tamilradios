# RadioPlus (PWA-ready)

Drop these files into a GitHub repo and enable GitHub Pages (branch `main`, root).
Edit `index.html` to change stations or images.

Stations are configured in the `STATIONS` array in `index.html`.

Note: If a stream fails to play in the browser but plays in VLC, it's likely CORS; you may need a proxy.
